# JetsProject



# Description
During this project I worked endlessly to put all the pieces together. I started out by going through the user stories to understand exactly what was being asked. After much thought, I decided my methods would be done in my air field, this made more sense to me as jets were being added and removed from the air field. Upon entering my jet app I have a list of my imports, under that I instantiated my air field and a scanner. My main is my only static method, I call the run method from the main method to work outside of a static method. I created a while loop to present the menu for the user as they go through the different options. Depending on which choice is made a specific method, that is being called from the air field is ran. Once complete the results are printed to the screen. I have a super class, the Jet, three concrete classes (Fighter, Cargo, Passenger), and two interfaces for the fighter and cargo jets. All classes work together to help my program run.

# Lessons Learned

I now have a better understanding of Inheritance and Polymorphism. I also have a better grasp on interfaces and how they work. I learned more about how to apply logic to my methods and I tried to understand how text files as well. I struggled with the idea of how the information was being passed between the jet app and air field classes. I think I really understood methods better this week. I learned so much but I know I have so much more to learn and practicing to do.
